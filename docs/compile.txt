                           How to compile the source

What you need:

IBM VAC++ 3.0 with OS/2 Toolkit
Squish MsgAPI Toolkit
Rexx
HPFS
Info-ZIP (when making binary distributions)

How to compile:

1. Edit MAKEFILE

The macro MSGAPIDIR must point to the directory where the Squish MsgAPI Toolkit
is located on your machine. Otherwise the source is completely position
independent.

2. Run nmake

Run nmake from the source directory. The compilation process should run to
the end. This takes 6 1/2 minutes on my machine.

3. Run program

All binary files are located in .\bin. Change to this directory and run
the program.

4. Cleanup

A complete cleanup procedure can be started with

nmake clean

from the source directory. This deletes all binary files and intermediate
files. INI files in the .\bin directory are not deleted, so after rebuilding
FleetStreet you can run it with the settings retained from a previous version.

5. Make binary distributions

To make a binary distribution (ZIP file containing installation program)
run

nmake binary

from the source directory. The file FLEET.ZIP is generated in the current
directory.
